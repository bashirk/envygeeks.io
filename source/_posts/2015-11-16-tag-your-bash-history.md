title: Tag your Bash history!
tags: [ubuntu, bash]

Everybody loves tags now.  You can't even escape them, so why not apply it to your Bash history? You can actually comment your Bash history the way you do your source code and like a hash tag they start with a "#":

```bash
echo "hello world" # my hello
# C-r (CTRL/CMD+R)
# my hello
```

Now go about tagging your history.
