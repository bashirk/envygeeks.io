# Jekyll Common Mark Highlighting

Provides Rouge Syntax Highlighting for Jekyll-CommonMark, fuckith because it doesn't provide it's own syntax highlighting, nore does it try to integrate with one.

## Usage

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-commonmark-rouge", git: {
    "https://github.com/envygeeks/envygeeks.io/jekyll-commonmark-rouge"
  }
end
```
