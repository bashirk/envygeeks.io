{% include about/popularity.html %} Hi üëã, I'm **Jordon Bedwell**. I'm an Open Source ‚ù§Ô∏è Programmer, **Programmer For Hire**, a systems person. I'm also a firm believer in Time Travel. I love Doctor Who, Family Guy, Downton Abbey, and helping people as much as I can. You might know me, you probably don't. I'm sure I've touched a project that you've used before, knowingly or not, and I plan to keep helping out Open Source for as long as I can, because everybody deserves high quality Open Source software.  It's even how I'm trying to make a living.

In the past it was my day to day job to scale and grow things like Jekyll builds to thousands of builds at once, with Docker, and to program applications that many users used between there, and those systems.  No, not at Github, somewhere else. I am also often hired to do custom Jekyll work, like teaching people how to get Jekyll to play well in a large org, or to build plugins to make life easier when working with Jekyll. When doing freelance work most people hire me to do initial ops work, Rails apps, and even systems programming with languages like Go, and Rust.  If you were to ask me what I do, I would say I "hack".

## Skills

{% asset gifs/clara-oswald-hacking.gif alt="Clara Hacking" %}

I am heavy Docker user, a Linux user, and I manage and maintain a great many Jekyll plugins, and other Ruby projects, that hopefully *you* love and enjoy. I've built tools like [Docker Template][2], plugins like [Jekyll Assets][3], and Docker images like [Jekyll Docker][1], and I currently manage many other Docker images.  Unless I've removed them, or planned to deprecate them because the ecosystem has taken over to do a better job.
