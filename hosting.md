Hosting with a personal touch.  All instances are managed by hand, and by bot.
I offer Docker hosting, static website hosting, and Jekyll instance hosting,
for those people who do not wish to pay an expensive price.  The catch is,
the Jekyll hosting is by year not by month. Please e-mail if you would
like hosting.
